        <div class="article-body"><p>As a scuba diver who often explores new places, I can say that I have found
myself in some dangerous situations, but I always made it back to the surface
without facing any negative consequences. Does this mean that I never made any
mistakes? Absolutely not: mistakes were made, and lessons were learned.</p>
<p>We can all agree that learning from mistakes is good, but sometimes, when
mistakes happen and consequences don’t manifest themselves immediately, we run
the risk of not noticing them, not learning from them, repeating them, and over
time developing a false sense of confidence, which can drive us to believe that
our repeated mistakes are actually good practices.</p>
<p>Why do we ignore mistakes? Because sometimes outcomes are positive even if we
make mistakes. “I made it out of water even this time, this means that my dive
was executed perfectly.” This is a common way of reasoning, but in reality,
things are much more complex than that. There is a difference between <em>correct
execution</em> and <em>successful outcome</em>, and the two should not be confused. In
fact, everyone should know from experience that goals can be achieved even if
the execution was sloppy and full of mistakes. Catastrophic consequences may
happen if we fail to see that.</p>
<p>An example of the consequences of ignoring mistakes is given by the two space
shuttle disasters: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster">Challenger disaster of
1986</a>, and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">Columbia disaster of
2003</a>. Both
these instances were caused by NASA leadership ignoring the concerns from the
engineering teams. Problems that occurred in previous shuttle launches should
have been a wake-up call for NASA leadership. Instead, all the previous
successful launches and re-entries <em>despite</em> the problems were seen as
accomplishments, and nourished the leadership’s overconfidence. “We have made
it this time too, this means that all those concerns that engineers raised were
excessive.”</p>
<p>The tendency of diverting from proper procedures, dismissing valid concerns,
and ignoring problems, has a name: it’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_of_deviance">normalization of
deviance</a>. The driving
force of normalization of deviance is overconfidence and the false belief that
positive outcomes are inherently caused by correct executions.</p>
<p>Overconfidence and normalization of deviance can spread like a virus in an
organization. It is important to be vigilant for signs of overconfidence in
individuals, before it infects other people. I once had to deal with a manager
who was a self-declared micromanager (and proud to be) but lacked technical
foundations and knowledge of the product. He would consistently and quickly
dismiss anything that he did not understand, and focus on short-term goals of
questionable usefulness. Whenever his team would accomplish a goal, he would
send a pumped-up announcement, often containing inaccuracies, and carefully
skipping over the shortcomings of the solutions implemented. Given the apparent
success of this management style, other managers started to follow his example.
Soon after (in less than a year), the entire organization became a toxic
environment where raising even the minimal concern was seen as an attack on the
“great new vision”.</p>
<p>I see many parallels between this manager story and what is happening with
‘Twitter 2.0’ right now (although, I must say, in my case engineers did not get
fired on the spot for speaking the truth). And with that manager, just like
with ‘Twitter 2.0’, whenever problems occurred, those problems would either be
ignored or blamed on the preexisting components built before the manager
joined, never on the new, careless developments.</p>
<p>The truth however was that problems that occurred had been preannounced weeks,
or months before, but concerns around them had been promptly dismissed due to
being too challenging to address, and because “everything works right now, so
that’s not a concern”.</p>
<p>The idea that everything must be correct because everything works, goals are
achieved, and outcomes are successful, is a dangerous idea that can potentially
have catastrophic consequences. It’s important to be critical and analytical,
regardless of the outcome. This does not mean that success shouldn’t be
celebrated, but that mistakes should be captured so that lessons can be learned
from them, <em>even if</em> the final outcome was successful. Not learning from
mistakes does not allow us to advance, and on the contrary can only lead us to
repeat them. And if we keep repeating the same mistakes, sooner or later, those
will have some negative consequences.</p>
<p>A common practice in the aviation industry is to write reports on incidents,
close calls, and near misses, whenever they occur, even if the flight was
concluded successfully and no injuries or damages occurred. These reports are
collected in databases like the <a href="https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/">Aviation Safety Reporting
System</a> (which can be freely consulted online), so
that flight safety experts and regulators can identify common failure scenarios
and eventually introduce mechanisms to improve safety in the aviation industry.
A key element of these reports is that they are not meant to put the blame on
certain people, but rather focus on what chain of events led to a certain
mistake. “Human mistake” is generally not a valid root cause: if a human was
able to make a mistake, it means that a mechanism is missing that can either
prevent the mistake or detect it before it causes any negative consequences.</p>
<p>Some companies in other industries have similar processes for writing reports
or retrospectives when a mistake happens (regardless of the outcome), with the
goal of finding proper root causes and preventing future mistakes. Amazon with
its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/why-you-should-develop-a-correction-of-error-coe/">Correction of
Error</a>
practice is a famous example.</p>
<p>I think introducing these practices in an organization can help to establish a
healthy culture where finding mistakes and raising concerns is encouraged,
rather than being oppressed. However these practices, by themselves, may not be
enough to ensure that such a culture can be maintained over time, because
people can always disagree on what is considered a ‘mistake’. Empathy is
probably the key to a truly healthy culture that allows people to learn and
advance.</p>
<p>There are also cases where we are aware of problems, and we see them as such,
but we deliberately choose not to do anything about them. This is where
resilience comes into play.</p>
<p>Resilience is generally a good quality to have. Resilience can give us the
strength to go through long-term hardships, and can have positive effects on
our tenancy and determination. But even resilience, when taken to the extreme,
can be dangerous. Resilience can lead us to ignore problems, and not react to
them. Resilience can make us tolerate a negative situation, without finding a
proper strategy to cope with it.</p>
<p>Poor planning forces you to consistently work extra hours? Resist and keep
going, until you burn out. The relationship with your partner doesn’t satisfy
you? Resist and think that things will get better, while the relationship
slowly deteriorates. Feel pain in your knee every time you run for more than 30
minutes? Resist and don’t go to see a doctor, the pain will go away, sooner or
later… until you cannot run anymore.</p>
<p>When we let resilience become an excuse to avoid solving problems, we can end
up in situations from which it’s difficult to recover.</p>
<p>It’s important to make a distinction between what is under our control and what
is not. We can fix problems that are under our control, but in situations where
we cannot directly change the course of things, finding an alternative strategy
is the only way. Resisting and hoping that things will get better often does
not give the expected outcome–on the contrary, it can be detrimental.</p>
<p>In the end, I think that the ‘practice’ of ignoring mistakes (because of the
overconfidence built from successful outcomes) or ignoring problems (because of
resilience taken to the extreme) are hidden time bombs, silently ticking,
waiting for the right conditions before exploding. We need to be aware that
just because things seem to work today, it doesn’t mean that we’re making the
right decisions, and this can have consequences in the future. Being critical,
analytical, empathetic, and honest is important to avoid these behaviors and
the dangers that come with them.</p></div>
