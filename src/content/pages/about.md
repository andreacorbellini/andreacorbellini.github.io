I'm a software developer from Italy, currently living in
[Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle).

I'm passionate about:

* Cloud computing: my dream is to build an autonomous, self-healing cloud.
* Information security: cryptography, authentication, validation. I think that
  building walls is more important than following conventions.
* Pure mathematics: in these days I'm particularly focused on algebraic
  topology, category theory and complex analysis.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually some meters underwater. The watery picture
above from the beautiful [Lake
Garda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Garda), in Italy, where I did
hundreds of dives. Nowadays I dive mostly in the [Puget
Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound) and [Lake
Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington).
