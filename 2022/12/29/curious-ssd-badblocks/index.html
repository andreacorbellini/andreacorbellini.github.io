        <div class="article-body"><p>I recently inherited a laptop that was broken by pouring some hot coffee on it.
When I dissected it, it was pretty clear that most of it was unrecoverable: the
CPU was completely fried, and its thermal paste splashed everywhere on the
motherboard. (I wish I took a picture of it that I could share.) There were
however a few pieces that looked in a good state. One of those components was a
NVMe Solid State Drive (SSD). I decided to take this SSD and recycle it in my
own laptop, maybe to join my LVM pool.</p>
<p>When I plugged it in my laptop however the SSD I tried to navigate the
filesystem, and it appeared to be working quite slowly. Opening certain files
sometimes would hang indefinitely. Upon inspection of the SMART data and the
kernel logs, it was clear that the drive was returning plenty of <strong>read
errors</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of the kernel logs:</p>

<p>These logs show that the SSD was returning errors (exceptions) to the operating
system, and also that the SSD would sometimes become so slow to respond that
the kernel would attempt to reset it (which didn’t really work, I can tell
you).</p>

<p>This table show various attributes for the operational status of the SSD. The
meaning of the numeric values is pretty much vendor-specific, so trying to
understand those number exactly is quite a challenge, but what matters is that
the numbers under the <code>VALUE</code> column are higher than the <code>THRESH</code> (threshold)
column. The <code>WORST</code> column indicates the lowest <code>VALUE</code> that has ever been
observed.</p>
<p>To my surprise, despite all the errors and hangs that the SSD was experiencing,
the SMART values looked pretty good. Sure, there’s a very low <code>WORST</code> value for
<code>Raw_Read_Error_Rate</code> (001, much lower than the threshold 001), and there is
also and indication that this attribute failed in the past, but besides that
everything looked acceptable enough.</p>
<p>Of course the SMART log was recording the read errors as well. Here’s another
excerpt from the output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ smartctl -a /dev/sda

<p>Give the lack of concrete signs of old age or extended damage to the SSD, I
wondered if it could be a link problem: maybe I did not insert the drive
correctly, or maybe a pin was dirty. But no: upon inspection I did not find any
issue, and after carefully reseating the drive, the problem was persisting.</p>
<p>I proceeded to run a SMART self test, here are the results (from most recent to oldest):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>SMART Self-test log structure revision number 1
Num  Test_Description    Status                  Remaining  LifeTime(hours)  LBA_of_first_error

</code></pre></div>

<p>The first two tests were interrupted by Linux, which tried to reset the device
while the tests were running. A self-test (as the name suggests) is completely
self contained and does not involve sharing of data between the SSD and the
operating system in the process. The fact that the self-test was failing due to
bad blocks was therefore a sign that this was not a link error, but that the
blocks were really damaged.</p>
<p>I decided therefore to give up on trying to fix the SSD, but I still wanted to
use it. After all, it was working for the most part: as long as you didn’t
access the bad blocks, the SSD would behave fine. So here is my plan: I would
format the SSD and create an ext4 filesystem on it, using <code>mkfs.ext4 -c</code>, which
would scan for and exclude bad blocks so that they wouldn’t be used. The
resulting filesystem would have less storage available than the advertised
capacity of the SSD, but that was an acceptable trade-off for me.</p>
<p>And here is the most interesting part: <code>mkfs.ext4 -c</code> <strong>discarded all blocks
before creating the filesystem</strong>. After that, it <strong>scanned for bad blocks and,
shockingly, it found none!</strong></p>
<p>SMART self-tests also did not report any error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>SMART Self-test log structure revision number 1
Num  Test_Description    Status                  Remaining  LifeTime(hours)  LBA_of_first_error
# 1  Extended offline    Completed without error       00%      1740         -
# 2  Short offline       Completed without error       00%      1738         -
</code></pre></div>

<p>All the read errors, exceptions and the hanging problem that kept appearing
before disappeared!</p>
<p>I’m not fully sure how to explain how this happened, but I did some research
and the general consensus is that discarding bad blocks won’t recover them. My
theory is that, when the coffee was poured on the laptop, a spike of voltage
led to incorrect values to be written to a few blocks that were in use at that
time, causing uncorrectable discrepancies between the data and the
error-correcting-codes of the SSD. Discarding the blocks reset both the data
cells and the ECC cells, removing all the inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Do you have a better explanation? Let me know in the comments!</p></div>
